    <center><h1>311 Calls: a window to life in New York</h1></center>
    <div class="story">
    <p>New York City is often referred to collectively as the five boroughs - Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan,

        The Bronx, and Staten Island.</p>

    <p>If the boroughs were each independent cities, four of the boroughs (Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan, and

    the Bronx) would be among the ten most populous cities in the United States (Staten island would be

    ranked 37th) ; these same boroughs are coterminous with the four most densely populated counties in

        the United States (New York [Manhattan], Kings [Brooklyn], Bronx, and Queens).</p>

    <p><b>311</b> is a special telephone number supported in many communities in Canada and the United States.

    The number provides access to non-emergency municipal services. People can call in many cities to

    find information about services, make complaints, or report problems like graffiti or road damage. The

    number 311 is intended in part to divert routine inquiries and non-urgent community concerns from the

    911 number which is reserved for emergency service. 311 has evolved with technological advances

    into a multi-channel service that connects citizen with government, while also providing a wealth of

        data that improves how cities are run.</p>

    <p>For us, we might find some interesting fact of New Yorkers’ life by exploring 311 data. After

    exploring the data we have, we found that, for the past seven years, below complaints are always listed

    on top of the complaint/requires list. For a busy city like New York, it might not be a surprise to see

    noise complaint is on top of the list; however, in such a modern city, it is a bit surprise to see that

    "Heating" and "Heat/Hot Water" are on top of those complaints. In deed, "Heating" and "Heat/Hot

        Water" are always listed at top 1 on the list.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Heating/Hot water</li>
        <li>Noise – Residential</li>
        <li>Light Condition</li>
        <li>Street Condition</li>
        <li>Blocked Driveway</li>
        <li>Water System</li>
        <li>Illegal Parking</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Can we see more from the data? What the Now Yorkers most concern about, or what the New Yorkers

    are struggling in their daily life; what factors have the most impact on their daily life; if special

    events/incidents have significant impact on New Yorkers’ daily life. And it is also interesting to see if

        there are any patterns regarding the five boroughs for those complaints.</p>

    <p>With those questions in mind we look future into our data. We found that Queens is "biggest" borough

    among five boroughs, but Brooklyn has the "biggest" complaints. But it is not a surprise if we look at

    population density; Brooklyn has larger population than Queens. On the other hand, Staten Island has

    the least "Heating" and "Heat/Hot Water" complaints/requires, but it is the third largest in area

        150 km<sup>2</sup>. It has 0.5% complaint rate regarding “heating” in year 2016 (2197 complaints over its

    population of 476,015), it is a lot more less than the overall New York complaint rate of 2.7%

    regarding “heating” in year 2016. What is on your mind now? You are right, Staten Island is the richest

        borough among five.</p>

        <p>(Complaint numbers info from dataset, populations info from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staten_Island">Wikipedia</a>

    , income info from <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/business/moneybox/2014/01/new_york_city_census_data_manhattan_and_brooklyn_are_much_poorer_than_you.html">here</a>
    )</p>

    <p>We design two visualization graphs with the goal to unfold some insight from 311 calls. The first graph

    is to show the distribution of complaint types among five boroughs. See below graph. On the right

    hand side of the New York map, the top 10 complaints/requires are listed. You can choose one or few

    of them to see the distribution according to the five boroughs; you can also specify the time/time

        window to see if different time has different affect on 311 calls.</p>

    <p>It is not hard to imagine, like “heating” complaint/requires have strong seasonal pattern, calls are

    highly concentrate in winter season; (---- Will add it if we can make a graph to show seasonal pattern.)

    requires regarding “snow” are mainly happened in winter, especially in January. On the other hand,

    “noise” complaints tend to have peaks on the weekends and on the public holidays. But, is there

    anything else? What factors have the most impact on New Yorkers’ daily life, if special

    events/incidents have significant impact on New Yorkers’ daily life? We found that other than the

    usually complains about "noise", "heating"; "LEAD” complaint become one on the top of the list on St

    Patrick’s Day. There are about 5,000 "Lead" complaints in year 2016, but there are 388 "Lead"

    complains on the single day of St Patrick's Day. It is almost 8% of the whole year’s complaints in a

        single day.</p>

    <p>The second graph is trying to find some insight of how events/incidents impact on 311 calls. We pick

    two events/incidents for each season, to see how are the impacts on 311 calls. (then will go on the

        descript how the interface works)</p>
